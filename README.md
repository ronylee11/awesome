# Usage

### How to use my setup?<br />

I have set my Modkey to Windows Key! If you do prefer Alt Key, set modkey to Mod1 in rc.lua!<br />
Here are the default keybindings that I have customized to my likings:<br />
Switching tags:<br />

```
Modkey+1 - switch to tag 1<br />
Modkey+2 - switch to tag 2<br />
Modkey+3 - switch to tag 3<br />
Modkey+4 - switch to tag 4<br />
Modkey+5 - switch to tag 5<br />
Modkey+F1 - switch to tag 6<br />
Modkey+F2 - switch to tag 7<br />
Modkey+F3 - switch to tag 8<br />
Modkey+F4 - switch to tag 9<br />
Modkey+F5 - switch to tag 10<br />
```

Switch Focus between apps:<br />

```
Modkey+K - next app<br />
Modkey+J - previous app<br />
Modkey+Enter - move currently focus app to main stack(switching app order)<br />
```

Moving app between tags:<br />
focus on the app that u want to move,<br />

```
ModKey+Shift+1-F5 - move app to tag 1-10<br />
```

Launching app:<br />
